## Main Information
Telemonitor is a telegram bot based on [aiogram](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram) for system monitoring. Bot is currently in progress of development, so features can be `added`/`changed`/`deprecated`.


## Features
### Stable

- Show system information (OS, Architecture, Uptime, User@Host)
- Reboot or Shutdown the system
- Notification message to all *whitelisted users* on bot startup
- [File transfer system](#file-transfer-system) *(Currently works only as `file`/`image` receiver)*
- Modify whitelisted users without restart
- Support of automated systemd service generation on linux machines (See [Systemd Service Control](#systemd-service-control))

### Development
Development features are in progress of development and *are unstable*, so they're disabled by default. Enable with [argument `--dev`](#optional-arguments). Use at your own risk and be ready to drown in errors.

- Send notification message to all whitelisted users on shutdown


## How to run
> Note that bot requires access to some system commands *(such as `shutdown` and `reboot`)*, so if you want all features to work as intended - run all commands from `root` *(with `sudo`)* or from user who has full access to those commands.

### Poetry
1. Install [`poetry`](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) dependency manager with `pip` or [from source](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#installation).
2. Go to cloned `Telemonitor` repository folder and run:
   ```bash
   poetry install --no-dev
   ```
3. After all packages successfully installed, run:
   ```bash
   poetry run telemonitor
   ```
4. On the first start `Telemonitor` will generate `config.json` *([about config](#configuration-file))* and exit. You will have to add `bot token` and `whitelisted users` to `config.json` and then go to `3.`

### Native PIP
> From version `4.0.0`, **Telemonitor** has support for native `pip` installation and further usage

1. *(optional)* Initialize python virtual environment and activate it
   > Use virtual environment only if you don't want to install **Telemonitor** system-wide

   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python3 -m venv .venv

   # Activate it
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Linux
   # -----
   source .venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
   ```
2. Install project dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install **Telemonitor** project
   ```bash
   python setup.py develop
   ```
4. Everything is ready! Now you can run **Telemonitor** with command
   ```bash
   python -m telemonitor
   ```

## Bot Commands
```
start - Start the bot
```

## Configuration File
This configuration file will be generated on first start in `./telemonitor/` directory and needs to be modified.

Configuration file will be automatically checked on each bot start to remove deprecated and add new *keys*, so there's *no need* to remove it on each update. All actions with config file will be listed in [log file](#logging).

### Default Config
```jsonc
{
    "config_version": 2,                    // Version of configuration file. Used for correct keys migration on update
    "log_files_max": 30,                    // Maximum amount of .log files in logs directory
    "bot": {
        "token": "123:token__here",         // Telegram bot api token
        "whitelisted_users": [              // Array with all whitelisted users ids
            000000000,                      // Sample ids
            111111111
        ],
        "state_notifications": true,        // Enable/Disable notification message on boot and shutdown event
        "enable_file_transfer": true        // Enable/Disable file transfer system
    },
    "systemd_service": {                    // Dictionary for linux systemd service status
        "version": -1,                      // Version of installed service file
        "launcher_script_path": "./xxxx.sh" // Path to the service startup shell script
    }
}

```


## File Transfer System *(FTS)*
This feature allows you to transfer files between bot's host machine and telegram user. Feature can be disabled by setting value of key `enable_file_transfer` to `false` in [configuration file](#configuration-file). All downloaded files will be saved to `./telemonitor/Shared` directory *(Does not exist by default and will be created on first `FTS` call)*.

> Note that **all transfered files will be stored on Telegram servers!**

> Currently this system supports only `documents` and `images` transfer **only from** *whitelisted telegram user* to *bot's host machine*

### How to
- Simply send any `file`/`image` to bot from your client and you will receive notification when all files will be downloaded to host.


## Systemd Service Control
There's special feature available **only** for `linux` platforms with `systemd` software suite. It provides user-friendly CLI to control *(install, remove, upgrade)* **systemd service**.

### How to
> Please note that you must run Telemonitor as root to install the service correctly.

> You will get output with the result of all CLI commands to your terminal and [log file](#logging)

- Installation of service is pretty easy. You should just run
  ```bash
  poetry run telemonitor service install
  ```
- To uninstall the service, run:
  ```bash
  poetry run telemonitor service remove
  ```
- Getting service status *(like service version)* can be done this way
  ```bash
  poetry run telemonitor service status
  ```
  > Note that this CLI command does not display service detailed information. To get this one you should use system command `systemctl status service-name-here`
- Checking installed service for any available upgrade
  ```bash
  poetry run telemonitor service upgrade
  ```
  > If any updates are available, you will be prompted to confirm their installation.

You can also get `CLI` help for for `service` command by running
```bash
poetry run telemonitor service --help
```

### Customization
By default, **Telemonitor** service uses launch script on path `./telemonitor/extensions/systemd_service/files/telemonitor_start.sh` with argument `poetry`. This behaviour can be changed by following this steps:
```ruby
----- [WIP] -----
```

## Logging
**Telemonitor** also supports logging with python [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module. All logs will be saved to `./telemonitor/Logs/` in format: `TMLog_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log`. Log folder will also be automatically cleaned after exceeding log files limit *(30 files)* inside of it. This limit can be changed in [configuration file](#configuration-file).
